If you have RED tests that won't turn GREEN:

1. Scroll to the bottom of the test page
2. Find "Diagnostic Data Export" section
3. Copy the JSON data
4. Send it to your developer with:
   - A screenshot of the test results
   - Which tests are failing
   - What you've tried so far

==========================================================================
SECURITY NOTE
==========================================================================

This test file requires admin access. If someone who is not an admin
tries to run it, they'll get an error message. This is for security.

After you're done testing, you can delete the test file if you want:
- Delete: /wp-content/themes/hello-elementor-child-rts-v3/rts-system-test.php

Or keep it for future testing - it's harmless and can only be accessed
by administrators.

==========================================================================
RUNNING THE TEST REGULARLY

You can run this test:
- After updating the theme
- After importing new letters
- If you notice dashboard numbers seem wrong
